# rangers-api
rangers-api is a reverse engineering attempt at creating an API library for Sonic Frontiers (codename: rangers) for easily creating mods that interact with the game universe.

Currently the library is in a very rudamentary state and is only released due to the external mods using it, developed by me, therefore there are no samples just yet.

The API is heavily based on [LWAPI](https://github.com/hedge-dev/LWAPI).
